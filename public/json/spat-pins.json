For the first goal, DSRC hardware from Arada, Savari, Cohda and Lear is deployed on the intersections of this corridor, and testing is on-going. Hardware includes RSUs which meet the USDOT 3.0 specification, and newer hardware which reportedly meets the 4.1 specification. OBUs from the same DSRC vendors are also being used. Signal controllers include the Econolite Cobalt and the Intelight controller. For the second goal, priority is currently being granted to Utah Transit Authority (UTA) buses along the south half of the corridor when they are behind schedule. A customized version of MMITSS is being used to provide this priority. Utah MMITSS is running on standalone Linux computers in the signal cabinets and on the buses, connected to Lear DSRC hardware. This is the first DSRC-based V2I corridor in the U.S. with data being actively used in operational decisions on a transportation system.",
